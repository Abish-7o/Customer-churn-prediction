📊 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s product or service. Predicting churn in advance allows businesses to take proactive actions to retain customers.
This project uses data analytics and machine learning to analyze customer behavior and predict churn.

🚀 Project Overview

This project performs:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand churn patterns

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Machine learning model training using Logistic Regression

Prediction of customers likely to churn

The project is completely free, offline, and suitable for a solo final-year project.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer data to identify churn trends

Build a machine learning model to predict churn

Help businesses take preventive retention actions

Demonstrate real-world use of data analytics and ML

🧠 Problem Statement

Businesses lose revenue when customers leave their services. Identifying customers who are likely to churn early can help organizations reduce losses and improve customer satisfaction. This project aims to predict customer churn using historical customer data.

📊 Dataset

Type: CSV (Tabular data)

Domain: Telecom customer data

Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

Features include:

Customer demographics

Account information

Services used

Billing details

🔍 Methodology

Loaded and understood the dataset

Cleaned data and handled missing values

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Predicted churn for new customers

📈 Results

The model achieved good prediction accuracy

Customers with short tenure, higher monthly charges, and month-to-month contracts showed higher churn risk

The model can effectively identify high-risk customers
